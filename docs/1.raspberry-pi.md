# Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W Setup Guide (Bookworm Lite)

This guide explains how to prepare a **microSD card** for your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W using the **Raspberry Pi Imager**. It walks through selecting the correct image, configuring Wi-Fi, setting up credentials, and assigning a hostname.

---

## 1. Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* A **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** board
* A **microSD card** (8 GB minimum, 16 GB recommended)
* A **microSD card reader** for your computer
* A stable **Wi-Fi network**
* A computer running **Windows, macOS, or Linux**
* The latest **Raspberry Pi Imager** installed ([Download here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software))

---

## 2. Launch Raspberry Pi Imager

1. Open the **Raspberry Pi Imager** application on your computer.
2. Click **"Choose Device"** and select **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**.

---

## 3. Choose the Operating System

1. Click **"Choose OS"**.
2. Navigate to:

   ```
   Raspberry Pi OS (other) → Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)
   ```

   This version (Bookworm Lite) is **command-line only** and ideal for robots or headless projects.

## 4. Select the Storage Device

1. Click **"Choose Storage"**.
2. Select your **microSD card** from the list. Make sure you choose the correct drive — this will erase all existing data.

---

## 5. Configure Advanced Settings

Click the small **gear icon ⚙️** or press **Ctrl + Shift + X** to open the **Advanced Options** menu.

Enable and configure the following:

### a. Set Hostname

```
spotmicroai
```

(You can choose another if desired, but `spotmicroai` is recommended.)

### b. Enable SSH

* Check **Enable SSH**
* Select **Use password authentication**

### c. Set Username and Password

Use simple credentials for first setup:

```
Username: pi
Password: raspberry
```

(You can change these later using the `passwd` command.)

### d. Configure Wi-Fi

Enter your Wi-Fi credentials:

```
SSID: <your_network_name>
Password: <your_network_password>
Country: US
```

Ensure the Wi-Fi name and password are typed exactly as they appear on your network.

### e. Set Locale Options

Optionally, adjust **Time Zone** and **Keyboard Layout** to match your region.

---

## 6. Save and Write the Image

1. Click **Save** to close the Advanced Options.
2. Click **Write** to begin flashing the SD card.
3. Wait for the process to complete — this may take a few minutes.
4. When finished, remove the SD card safely from your computer.

---

## 7. Boot the Raspberry Pi

1. Insert the flashed microSD card into the **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**.
2. Connect power via the **micro-USB port**.
3. Wait for it to boot (usually 30–60 seconds).

If configured correctly, your Pi will:

* Automatically connect to your Wi-Fi
* Be reachable via SSH at the hostname you set

You can verify connectivity by running from another computer on the same network:

```bash
ping spotmicroai.local
```

Or SSH into it directly:

```bash
ssh pi@spotmicroai.local
```

(Use the password you configured earlier.)

---

## 8. Optional: Verify System Details

Once connected, check:

```bash
hostnamectl
```

This confirms your hostname, OS version (Bookworm Lite), and architecture.

---

## 9. Next Steps

* Update packages: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
* Install additional tools if needed (`git`, `python3`, `pip`, etc.)
* Begin deploying your robot or automation code.

Your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W is now ready for headless operation.
